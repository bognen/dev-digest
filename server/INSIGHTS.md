## What Works

## What Doesn't Work

## Codebase Patterns

### 2026-09-24 — Prompt-assembly logging: reading `container.config` in a hot path breaks unit tests with a hand-rolled `Container` fake, and tokenizing every section instead of an estimate is a real perf/behavior regression
Adding a structured log of prompt sections (name/source/length) after `reviewPullRequest` resolves in `run-executor.ts` hit two traps at once. First, several existing unit tests (`run-executor-skills.test.ts`) build `container` as a plain object with only the fields that test needs (`{ runBus, tokenizer, llm, git, repoIntel }`, no `config`) — reading `this.container.config.promptLogVerbose` unguarded threw `TypeError` inside `runOneAgent`'s try block, which the existing catch swallowed into a "failed" run, so 14 tests failed with confusing "spy not called" errors far from the real cause; `this.container.config?.promptLogVerbose` fixed it without weakening the real (always-present) production `Container`. Second, the section-length helper originally called `this.container.tokenizer.count()` (the real tiktoken tokenizer, same one used for `skills_tokens`) on every section including the fully-assembled `user` message — i.e. the whole diff — on every review call; this both broke tests asserting `tokenizer.count` is called ONLY for the skills block, and would have been a real CPU cost per review for no reason. Fixed by using the same cheap `ceil(len/4)` estimate already used elsewhere in this codebase (see `PromptAssemblyMeta.skills_tokens`'s doc comment) instead of the real tokenizer, for every section except the one place the real tokenizer already applies.

### 2026-09-24 — Intent Layer: `ensure()`'s fail-open contract only holds if the logger moves to per-call opts, not the Deps bundle
`IntentService` is built ONCE in `ReviewService`'s constructor from `IntentDeps` (`store`, `llm`, `resolveModel`, `github`, `now?`) — there is deliberately no `log` field there, because a pino/`req.log` instance is request-scoped and the service is constructed before any request exists. Logging instead travels through `IntentEnsureOpts.log` (optional), supplied per call: the executor passes its `Logger`, `service.generateIntent` passes `req.log`. `ensure()` itself catches every internal failure (missing key → `ConfigError` → `provider_not_configured`, timeout via a `Promise.race` that always `clearTimeout`s, an empty sanitized statement → thrown `schema_invalid` message) so it never throws — `run-executor.ts` still wraps the call in a defensive `try/catch` around `runLog.step` anyway, since a queued run left un-awaited by a broken contract would strand every job in that batch at `status='running'` forever.

### 2026-09-24 — Confidence is computed from which SIGNALS were available, not from the model's answer, and it never becomes a numeric field anywhere
`deriveConfidence({ descriptionSubstantive, linkedIssueSubstantive })` (`reviews/pipeline/intent-signals.ts`) is the ONLY place confidence is set; the structured-output schema (`INTENT_SCHEMA = Intent` from `@devdigest/shared`) has no confidence field at all, so the model is structurally incapable of reporting one. `sources` (which signal kinds were non-empty and sent) is recorded independently of substantiveness — e.g. a one-line PR body like "fix bug" still adds `'description'` to `sources` (it was sent) even though it doesn't make `descriptionSubstantive` true (confidence stays `low`). Don't conflate "sent" with "counted toward confidence" when touching either list.

### 2026-09-24 — Mirroring a vendored contract with an agent's file-write tool can silently flip line endings
This checkout's vendored `contracts/*.ts` files are CRLF (Windows `core.autocrlf=true` checkout); a fresh `Write` of the whole-file mirror (as the existing "copy whole-file" entry below recommends) produced LF-only output, so `scripts/check-vendor-shared-sync.sh` reported drift even though the two files were textually identical byte-for-byte apart from line endings. `Edit` on an existing file preserves the file's current line endings; `Write` does not — normalize (`sed -i 's/$/\r/'` or equivalent) after a `Write`-based mirror, or prefer `Edit` for the mirrored copy when the change is small enough.

### 2026-09-20 — Conventions scan: the model only proposes, code chooses what it reads and verifies what it claims
`modules/conventions` samples config files + `repoIntel.getConventionSamples` (no LLM), makes ONE structured call, then drops any candidate whose cited path isn't in the sampled set or whose snippet isn't really in the file (wrong line is corrected, fabricated code is dropped); repo content goes through `wrapUntrusted`. The Zod field order (`rule, rationale, evidence_path, evidence_line, evidence_snippet, category, occurrences, confidence`) is load-bearing — with `category` first the model collapsed to a flat 0.90 over 1 of 8 categories. Re-scan replaces only `pending` rows; `rejected` rows stay for de-dup (`ruleKey`) but are never returned. `repo-conventions` is ONE workspace-wide skill (upsert by name), so saving from a second repo overwrites the first repo's version — known limitation of the plan's D9, not a bug to patch quietly.

### 2026-09-20 — Skill injection scan: a tripwire on every body write, blocking = auto-disable + 422, not a security boundary
`skills/injection.ts` is deterministic pattern matching (no LLM), run by `SkillsService` on create/update/URL-import/restore; block rule = ≥1 high or ≥2 medium matches. Flagged ⇒ `enabled` forced false, `PUT enabled:true` and `POST /agents/:id/skills` return 422 `SKILL_BLOCKED`. Already-linked skills that later get flagged are exempt from the link 422 (so reorder/unlink still saves) and `run-executor.resolveActiveSkills` skips them. Tuning trap: legit security skills discuss injection in the third person, so the detector exempts quoted phrases after a reporting cue and `<untrusted>` inside inline code — a test iterates `SEED_SKILLS` and every repo `.md` so a new seeded skill that trips it fails CI.

### 2026-09-20 — Skill restore is append-only; URL import SSRF guard lives in the connect-time `lookup`
`POST /skills/:id/versions/:v/restore` writes version N+1 with the old body and `restored_from = v` (never rewinds — `skill_versions` PK is `(skill_id, version)` and history is an audit trail); 409 when `v` is current. For `POST /skills/import-url`, resolving DNS first and then fetching is open to DNS rebinding, so the private/loopback/link-local/metadata check runs inside a guarded `lookup` at connect time — but Node's `https.request` skips `lookup` for IP-literal hosts, so those are pre-checked separately (`adapters/url-fetcher/ssrf.ts`). The `UrlFetcher` port is declared in `adapters/url-fetcher/types.ts` and mirrored as `SkillUrlFetcher` in the skills module because adapters may not import modules.

### 2026-09-19 — Skill usage stats: `agent_run_skills` is the only record of which skills fired, and accept-rate is correlational
A run's skills are decided at run time (linked in `agent_skills` AND `skills.enabled`), so history can't be reconstructed later from current links — `ReviewRepository.recordRunSkills` writes `agent_run_skills` right after `completeAgentRun('done')` (`reviews/run-executor.ts`), so failed/cancelled runs record nothing and pre-feature runs have no rows. `pull_rate` = those rows ÷ `done` runs of agents that *currently* link the skill (kept ≤100%). `accept_rate`/`findings_by_category` join `findings → reviews.run_id → agent_run_skills`: findings are never attributed to a specific skill (the model doesn't say which one triggered it), so treat these as "findings from runs where the skill was on", and a run with several categories counts its cost in each. Don't "fix" this into causal attribution without a schema for it.

### 2026-09-19 — "Auto-invocation disabled" agent = `agents.enabled: false`, no new flag needed
`ReviewService.resolveTargets({ all: true })` uses `listEnabled` (skips disabled agents) while `resolveTargets({ agentId })` calls `getById` with no `enabled` filter (`reviews/service.ts:46-57`). So the seeded `pr-self-review` (`enabled: false`) never runs on "Run all" but can still be run by picking it explicitly. Note the polling module never calls `resolveTargets` — "auto" runs are only the client's `all:true` action.

### 2026-09-19 — Onion layering is now machine-checked; the baseline (42 entries) may only shrink
`server/.dependency-cruiser.cjs` + `pnpm arch:check` (CI job `arch` in `server-unit.yml`) enforce inward-only imports over the flat per-module files; rules/rationale in `.claude/skills/onion-architecture/`. Pre-existing debt is frozen in `.dependency-cruiser-known-violations.json` (routes running Drizzle in `pulls|polling|settings|workspace`, ORM row types in `repos/helpers.ts` + `reviews/*`, whole-`Container` in every service, `repo-intel` importing concrete adapters). Never add to the baseline to make CI green — fix the import or move the code; run `pnpm arch:baseline` only after fixes and check the diff is removals-only.

### 2026-09-18 — PR-list SCORE/STATUS/FINDINGS now dedupe to each agent's LATEST review, not every review ever
`server/src/modules/pulls/routes.ts`'s aggregation previously counted EVERY
completed `reviews` row for a PR when computing lowest score, worst verdict,
and summed findings — a re-run of the same agent stacked its stale first pass
on top of the clean re-run, so a PR could show a permanently bad
score/status/findings from a superseded run. Fixed per explicit user request:
`reviews` rows are now deduped by `(prId, agentId)`, ordered `desc(createdAt)`
with first-seen-per-key kept, so re-running an agent SUPERSEDES its prior
review rather than adding to the aggregate; a different agent's latest review
still contributes alongside it. A null `agentId` can't be deduped against
other runs, so each such review is grouped by its own row id (never merged
with other unattributed reviews).

### 2026-09-18 — COST aggregation deliberately stays "every run", NOT "latest per agent"
Unlike score/status/findings (entry above), the COST query
(`agent_runs.cost_usd`, summed over `status='done'`) intentionally still
counts every completed run, including re-runs of the same agent — cost is
real money spent, so every attempt counts, not just the latest. This is an
asymmetry between the two aggregations, not an oversight; see the comment
above the cost query in `routes.ts`.

### 2026-09-18 — `findings: null` must mean "no review yet", never "zero findings on the latest review"
While testing the latest-per-agent fix above, found that a PR whose only
qualifying review has zero findings was returned as `findings: null` —
indistinguishable from "no completed review exists at all" (also `null`),
because the findings map was only ever populated by iterating actual finding
rows via an inner join. Fixed by explicitly zero-filling `findingsByPr` for
every PR with at least one qualifying review, even when that review (or all
of a PR's latest-per-agent reviews) has no findings. `null` is now reserved
strictly for "no completed review yet" — don't let a zero-count case fall
through to it again in a future aggregation change here.

### 2026-09-18 — Mirroring a vendored contract file: copy whole-file when both copies started identical
When `client/src/vendor/shared/contracts/platform.ts` and
`server/src/vendor/shared/contracts/platform.ts` are confirmed byte-identical
(`diff` returns nothing) before editing, the safest way to mirror a multi-part
change (new `PrStatus` value + new `PrMeta.findings` field, this session) is
to make the edit once and then `cp` the whole file across, not hand-apply the
same diff twice — avoids a transcription slip silently desyncing the two
copies (see the existing "Shared contracts are vendored" entry below for why
that's dangerous).

### 2026-09-18 — `reviews` rows only ever exist for successfully completed runs — no need to join `agentRuns.status`
Confirmed by reading `modules/reviews/run-executor.ts:219-229`: `insertReview`
is called only after `reviewPullRequest(...)` resolves without throwing. The
PR-list score/verdict/findings aggregation queries in `modules/pulls/routes.ts`
therefore read straight from `reviews`/`findings` with no join to
`agent_runs.status='done'` — unlike the pre-existing cost query, which DOES
join `agent_runs` because it reads `agent_runs.cost_usd` directly, a different
table with rows for in-flight/failed runs too. Don't add an unnecessary status
join here; it would be redundant.

### 2026-09-18 — PR-level STATUS now also aggregates across every completed run, unscoped to the current head
`deriveReviewStatus` (`modules/pulls/status.ts`) gained an optional
`worstVerdict` param and a new `changes_requested` `PrStatus`, returned
whenever ANY completed review on the PR has `verdict='request_changes'` —
checked BEFORE the head-freshness check, so a past request-changes verdict
still shows even if a newer head hasn't been re-reviewed. This mirrors how
cost/score already aggregate across the PR's whole run history rather than
just the latest head; see the function's jsdoc for the full rationale.

### 2026-09-18 — `rollupSeverities` was dead code until the PR-list FINDINGS column needed it
`modules/pulls/status.ts`'s `rollupSeverities` existed only for its own unit
test since it was added. Its first real caller is the new findings-aggregation
query in `modules/pulls/routes.ts` (`findings` joined to `reviews`, grouped in
JS per PR, `rollupSeverities` called once per group).

### 2026-09-16 — `cost_usd` is `.nullish()` on `PrMeta` but `.nullable()` on `RunStats`/`RunSummary`
`PrMeta` rows are built in places that predate cost data and have no cost to
report (GitHub sync in `adapters/github/octokit.ts`, test fixtures in
`adapters/mocks.ts`) — `.nullish()` lets them omit the field entirely.
`RunStats`/`RunSummary` are only ever constructed at the one call site
(`modules/reviews/run-executor.ts` → `repository/run.repo.ts`) where cost is
already resolved to a value or `null`, so `.nullable()` forces that call site
to stay explicit instead of silently omitting it.

### 2026-09-16 — Per-run cost lives only on `agent_runs`, not duplicated onto `reviews`
Unlike `score`, which is denormalized onto both `agent_runs` and `reviews`
(`db/schema/reviews.ts`), `agent_runs.cost_usd` was deliberately NOT mirrored
onto `reviews` — nothing reads cost off a review row, and the PR list's
latest-cost aggregation (`modules/pulls/routes.ts`) queries `agent_runs`
directly. Don't reflexively mirror every `agent_runs` stat onto `reviews`;
only do it if something actually reads it from there.

### 2026-09-16 — Score is always recomputed from grounded findings
Models reliably return a self-reported `score` inconsistent with their own
findings list. Fix: `scoreFromFindings()` recomputes deterministically
(0 findings ⇒ 100; −35/−12/−3 per CRITICAL/WARNING/SUGGESTION) and the model's
number is discarded outright. Do not reintroduce a path that reads the model's
`score` field.

### 2026-09-16 — Shared contracts are vendored, not a real shared package
`@devdigest/shared` lives at `server/src/vendor/shared` **and separately** at
`client/src/vendor/shared` — copy-pasted, not symlinked, because there's no
workspace tool. Editing one without the other silently desyncs request/response
contracts between client and server with no compiler error until runtime.

## Tool & Library Notes

### 2026-09-20 — A "green" `.it` run can be 100% skipped: `dockerAvailable()` uses a 5 s `docker info` timeout
`test/helpers/pg.ts` skips every integration file when `docker info` doesn't answer within 5 s, and Docker Desktop on Windows does exactly that while it's busy (e.g. right after other testcontainers runs). The summary then reads `N skipped` with 0 failures. Always check the `skipped` count in the vitest summary; if it's non-zero for `*.it.test.ts`, rerun once Docker is responsive (`docker info` by hand) before trusting the result.

### 2026-09-20 — drizzle-kit: an un-exported schema file becomes `DROP TABLE`; dropping a column makes `db:generate` interactive
A new `db/schema/<x>.ts` must be re-exported from the `db/schema.ts` barrel *before* `pnpm db:generate`, otherwise the generated migration drops the table it can't see. Renaming/dropping a column makes drizzle-kit prompt interactively (pipe `\r` to accept the default), and it will NOT carry data — hand-add the `UPDATE` before the `DROP COLUMN` (see `0014_conventions_triage.sql`, `accepted` → `status`). Also: jsonb doesn't preserve object key order, so compare persisted `injection_matches` via a canonical form, not `toEqual` on a string.

### 2026-09-20 — Seeds: edits to a seeded skill body never reach an existing DB; skill bodies are joined without their names
`seed-skills.ts` inserts a skill only if its name is missing, so changing e.g. `test-coverage-nudge` needs a manual update (or a new version) on databases that already seeded it. `run-executor` joins skill bodies without their names, so every body must start with its own `# Title`. Seed skills for the API Contract Reviewer are read from `docs/agent-skills/api-contract-reviewer/*.md` at module load — the seed throws if `docs/` isn't on disk (check any Docker image that runs the seed), and CI path filters don't cover that folder.

### 2026-09-19 — dependency-cruiser 17.4: four quirks that break the docs' recipe
(1) No `--baseline` flag (the `main` docs describe a newer CLI) — generate with `depcruise src --config … --output-type baseline > .dependency-cruiser-known-violations.json`; no `shrink-only` mode, so review the diff by hand. (2) `tsPreCompilationDeps: true` is mandatory, otherwise `import type` / `typeof t.x.$inferSelect` leaks are invisible (TS elides them). (3) `dependencyTypesNot: ['type-only']` on a `circular` rule only exempts cycles whose *first* edge is type-only — `Container ↔ RepoIntelService` still reports. (4) Drizzle edges resolve to `node_modules/.pnpm/drizzle-orm@<ver>…`, so baseline entries for them go stale on upgrade (regenerate, confirm count unchanged). Because `package.json` may be skip-worktree (below), CI runs `pnpm exec depcruise …` inline rather than `pnpm arch:check`.

### 2026-09-16 — `reviewer-core` needs its own `npm ci`, separate from server's `pnpm install`
`server/tsconfig.json` path-aliases straight into `reviewer-core/src` (raw
source, not a built package), so `pnpm typecheck`/`pnpm test` in `server/`
fail with misleading `Cannot find module 'openai'`/`'zod'` errors — that look
like server bugs — unless `reviewer-core/node_modules` is installed
separately via `npm ci` (it's an npm package per `reviewer-core/CLAUDE.md`,
not pnpm). `./scripts/dev.sh` already does this
(`[ -d reviewer-core/node_modules ] || (cd reviewer-core && npm ci)`); a bare
`pnpm install` in `server/` alone does not.

### 2026-09-16 — `server/package.json` is `skip-worktree`
A local variant of `package.json` diverges from the committed file on some dev
machines (`git update-index --skip-worktree` hides that from `git status`).
**Consequence:** CI cannot rely on committed `test`/`typecheck` npm scripts
matching what's actually run locally — it invokes `pnpm exec vitest run …`
directly instead. If you add or rename a script, check
`git ls-files -v | grep '^S'` first or your change may silently not apply for
whoever has the skip-worktree bit set.

## Recurring Errors & Fixes

### 2026-09-20 — Fixed: `reviews.it` "run all" now mocks every provider; `run-skills.it` polls for post-`done` writes
Corrects the 2026-09-19 `reviews.it` entry below: `appWith` (`test/reviews.it.test.ts`) now registers mocks for `openai`, `anthropic` AND `openrouter`, so `all: true` no longer reaches a real adapter (an earlier test in the same shared DB creates an enabled `anthropic` agent, which was a second unmocked provider — mocking only openrouter left the total at 0.009 vs 0.010). Separately, `run-executor` writes `agent_run_skills` and the trace AFTER flipping the run to `done`, so `waitForPrRuns` returning does not mean those rows exist: `run-skills.it` failed ~2 runs in 3 under a loaded machine until it wrapped both reads in `vi.waitFor`. Any new test reading run side-effects (skills, trace) right after `waitForPrRuns` needs the same poll.

### 2026-09-20 — `indexer-pipeline.test.ts` fails 6 tests on Windows (ENOENT in `writeFileAt`) — pre-existing, not a regression
`writeFileAt` (`test/indexer-pipeline.test.ts:142`) finds the parent dir with `lastIndexOf('/')` on a `path.join` result, which uses `\` on Windows, so `mkdir` is skipped and `writeFile` throws ENOENT. The 6 failures show up in every full unit run on Windows and are unrelated to whatever you're changing — confirm the failing file is untouched (`git status`) before chasing them. Real fix (not done): use `path.dirname`.

### 2026-09-19 — `reviews.it` "run all enabled agents" runs against the REAL provider; it's machine-dependent, not skills-related
The seeded agents all use `DEFAULT_PROVIDER` (openrouter) but the test only mocks `openai` (`test/reviews.it.test.ts:113-125`), so `all: true` runs hit the real openrouter adapter. With no key the runs fail and the PR's `cost_usd` is `null` (`expected null to be close to 0.004`); with `~/.devdigest/secrets.json` present it makes real, billed calls and can blow the 10s `waitForPrRuns`. Every new *enabled* seeded agent adds one more (the "seed has 2 enabled agents" comment is stale). To run it safely, hide the keys: `HOME=/tmp/nohome USERPROFILE=<empty dir> pnpm exec vitest run test/reviews.it.test.ts`. Real fix (not done): register mocks for the seed agents' provider in `appWith`. Diagnosed by reading the code, not by running against a clean checkout.

### 2026-09-18 — Deleting a review left an orphaned Timeline tile: two tables, one unenforced link, one-way cleanup
`reviews` and `agent_runs` represent the SAME run from two angles (Review-runs
section vs. Timeline), linked only by a bare `reviews.run_id` uuid column —
no FK (unlike `run_traces.run_id`, which DOES have a real FK with
`onDelete: cascade` back to `agent_runs`). `deleteAgentRun`
(`repository/run.repo.ts`, Timeline's delete) already manually deleted the
matching `reviews` row via `eq(reviews.runId, runId)`. `deleteReview`
(`repository/review.repo.ts`, Review-runs section's delete) did NOT do the
reverse — it only deleted `reviews` (+ findings via a real FK cascade),
leaving the `agent_runs` row, and thus its Timeline tile, behind forever.
User-reported as "agent runs out of sync with the timeline" after deleting
from the Review-runs section. **Fix:** `deleteReview` now also deletes the
matching `agent_runs` row (via the deleted review's `run_id`), whose own
cascade cleans up `run_traces` too — symmetric with `deleteAgentRun`. Covered
by `server/test/reviews-delete.it.test.ts` (checks both delete paths against
the other table). **Lesson:** whenever two tables represent the same
real-world entity via a non-FK link, audit BOTH delete paths for symmetry
before shipping either one — a real FK would have caught this via a
constraint/cascade; a bare uuid column lets the tables silently drift apart.

### 2026-09-16 — `db:migrate`/`db:seed` were no-ops on Windows: bad CLI-entrypoint guard
`src/db/migrate.ts:37` and `src/db/seed.ts:227` gated their CLI body on
`import.meta.url === \`file://${process.argv[1]}\``. On Windows,
`import.meta.url` is `file:///C:/...` (forward slashes) while
`process.argv[1]` is `C:\...` (backslashes) — always unequal, so the guard
silently never fires: the script exits 0 with zero output and does nothing.
Symptom was brutal to spot — `./scripts/dev.sh` reported "✓ migrations
applied"-adjacent success at every step and the API server started and
listened fine, but every table was missing (`docker exec devdigest-postgres
psql -U devdigest -d devdigest -c '\dt'` → zero relations); the only hint was
a buried non-fatal startup warning, `relation "agent_runs" does not exist`.
**Fix:** compare filesystem paths, not raw strings —
`fileURLToPath(import.meta.url) === resolve(process.argv[1])`. If you add
another `tsx`-run CLI script with this entrypoint pattern, use the fixed form
from the start; grep for `import.meta.url === ` before assuming a "successful"
CLI script run actually did anything on Windows.

## Session Notes

## Open Questions

### 2026-09-19 — `test/indexer-pipeline.test.ts` fails 6 tests on Windows (unrelated to skills)
Its helper splits paths with `full.lastIndexOf('/')` (`indexer-pipeline.test.ts:~142`) so `mkdir` never creates the nested dir on a backslash path and `writeFile` throws ENOENT under `%TEMP%\repo-intel-*`. Present before the Skills work (untouched by it); the unit suite therefore shows 115/121 on Windows. Not fixed here — use `path.dirname` when someone owns that test.
